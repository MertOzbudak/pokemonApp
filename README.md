A simple Pokédex application using Poke API and React Native.

My app is able to do the following tasks:

1.	List pokémons using the API 
2.	Show pokémon details
3.	Catch pokémons and keep the déx record in Redux
4.	Release pokémons 
5.	List caught pokémons 
6.	Add/remove favorite caught pokémons 
7.	Dark/Light theme
